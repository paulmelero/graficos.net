As of January 2026, this is the current state of things.

- **Side projects**: I'm proud I've publised a few projects like the new version of graficos.net, a VS Code extension, and some articles.
- **Writing**: I have been a little bit more active on the blog.
- **Reading**: I have been reading "Sapiens".
- **Life**: I have embraced the fully remote work lifestyle and I'm enjoying it a lot.
