As of July 2025, this is the current state of things.

- **Side projects**: paused a bit to focus on more important things like family and work, I want to finish 2 of them by the end of the year. I will be sharing more about them soon.
- **Writing**: Not so much lately. I published 2 articles on the blog, though!
- **Reading**: I stoped reading the Rust book for now, but want to finish it before EOY.
- **Work**: I have been 5 months in the new team. Still challenging, but I love learning new things and being able to work remotely.
