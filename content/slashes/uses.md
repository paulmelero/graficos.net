## IDE

VS Code, but I am giving Cursor a try!

### Editor's Theme

Dracula

### Editor's Font

IntelOne Mono

## Terminal

iTerm2

## Browser

~Brave~ (but also test manually in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). I've been happily using Brave but I discovered that Brendan Eich, CEO of Brave, is a supporter of anti-gay movements, and I've decided to switch to other browsers. Let's give Vivaldi a try!
