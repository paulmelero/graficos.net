## What are the skills of a Senior Engineer?

The problem is that you cannot be a Senior knowing the basics. Senior (or more knowledgeable people, in general) have had the time and put the effort to **deep dive** in a few or many topics. That goes for the so-called "hard skills". But to me, the most important skills of a Senior Engineer are commonly referred to as "soft skills" (or Engineering Best Practices).

That being said, some skills in one company or industry might be more important than in others, but in general:

### **Communication & Problem-Solving**

- Master the ability to break down complex problems in simple problems. This is not just a skill useful for the job, but also in life. It is the foundational skill that will unblock other skills like time management, prioritization, and decision-making, communication, etc.
- You should know how to explain complex technical problems to non-technical people.

### **Code Quality & Maintenance**

Be mindful that you will spend more time reading code than writing it during your career.

- Know how to **debug** the code. Debugging skills are so powerful. Sometimes it requires more patience than skills. You might not understand code you did not write but knowing how to debug it gives you the understanding you are missing.
- Write **readable code**. Easy-to-read code is so important. This one is also related to patience. I'm sure you have heard the saying "First you make it work, then you make it right".
- Learn the importance of **decoupling modules**. Writing independent modules make your code easier to test, to change, and to delete. Read more about how to make your code "deletable".
- You should know the basics of **testing** and practice testing frequently.

### **Continuous Learning**

Growth comes from learning from others:

- Read books (or watch videos, read articles, etc.) by people smarter than you about what they are learning. Ask your fellow senior/staff engineers for **recommendations**.
- According to the "learning pyramid", the best way to learn is to **teach**. So, try to teach what you learn to someone else. It will help you solidify your understanding and help you learn better. This is also a good strategy to escape the "tutorial hell" that many developers fall into during their early career. Since we all do not learn the same way, maybe you find that you learn better by writing a blog post about what you are learning than presenting it in a meeting or a conference talk, but what is important is that you are taking an "active sharing role" in your learning process.

### **Collaboration**

Finally, remember that software development is very rarely a **1-person job**:

- Invest time learning how to work as a team member. Coding is a social practice. Read about **pair programming** and try practising it with someone else. It will make you a better engineer and a better team member.
- In a remote team, learn how to communicate effectively with your colleagues. Use tools like **Slack**, **Teams**, **Zoom**, **Microsoft Teams**, etc. to stay connected with your team and make your work visible to your colleagues.

This is a short list that came out from the top of my head. Some of these points require time to develop, but all of them are worth the effort.

> I find those to be the most important skills of a Senior Engineer, transversally applied to all areas of the job. Some companies or products might have different priorities, but in general, these are the skills that will make you a better Senior Engineer all around your career.
