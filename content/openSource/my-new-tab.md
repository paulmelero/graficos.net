> Personal new tab extension (Chromium Browsers only).

I created this browser extension to replace the new tab page with a custom page that shows a simple ToDo list. This helps me stay focused on my tasks and avoid distractions when I open a new tab, specially since I [use](https://graficos.net/slashes/uses) Brave as my main browser, which has a new tab page that is too distracting for me.

I built it with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is open source. You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/paulmelero/my-new-tab).
