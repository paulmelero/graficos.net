## Origins

Graficos.NET has been my personal project since the early 2000s, when I was a kid. When I started working in the industry many years later, I always wanted to revive it. And I did, in 2018.

Since then, I have been committed to open source, and my site has been changing with the technology, serving as a guide for other folks wanting to learn Vue, Nuxt, Vite, and other related technologies.

[The first public modern version of the source code](https://github.com/paulmelero/graficos.net/commit/4565b8b17cc0ce56a948020a25d07ad8a2e82c84#diff-7ae45ad102eab3b6d7e7896acd08c427a9b25b346470d7bc6507b6481575d519) of this site was built with Nuxt 1, and I have since migrated it to Nuxt 3, which is now the latest version of Nuxt. The site is hosted nowadays on Cloudflare, and I use various Nuxt modules to enhance its functionality.

As you can see, I have been using Nuxt for a long time, and I am very happy with the framework and its online community.

## Current Days

This site will always be a work in progress, and I will continue to improve it as I learn new things and as the technology evolves. I hope you find it useful, and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.

## Open Source

I have always been committed to open source, and I believe that it is important to share knowledge and help others learn. Teaching is one of my passions, knowledge-sharing is the core principle that started The World Wide Web.

I wish I had more time to dedicate to open source, but I am always looking for ways to contribute and help others. I have a few open source projects that I maintain, but none of them are used by more than a handful of people.

I have archived some of my older projects, and I hold them dear, but I am not actively maintaining them anymore. I have only a little bit of hope for other projects I have worked on.

I also publish some public repos in my [GitHub](https://github.com/paulmelero) account. I have a few projects that I am working on, but they are not ready to be shared yet.
