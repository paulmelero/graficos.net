Convert SVG code to displayable images with real-time preview.

PasteSVG is a tool to paste SVG code into a text area and get the rendered SVG image. It is built with Vue and Nuxt, and it is open source.

This tool helps you visualize SVG graphics without needing to save files or use external editors. Perfect for web developers, designers, and anyone working with SVGs.

I made it to help me download SVG code from the web when I inspect elements and find out the SVG was inlined in the HTML. I wanted to have a tool that would allow me to paste the SVG code and see it rendered instantly, so that I could download it as a file or copy it to my clipboard.
