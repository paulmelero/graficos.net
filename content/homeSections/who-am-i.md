Hi, I’m **Paul Melero**.

I’m someone who builds things — sometimes with code. I've been in The Internet for over two decades, creating digital experiences that feel solid, thoughtful, and useful. Technology is part of my craft, but it’s never been the whole story.

I care deeply about curiosity, learning, creativity, and sharing. That’s what keeps long-running projects like graficos.net alive: a personal playground that reflects how I think, what I’m exploring, and what I enjoy giving back to the community. Teaching, writing, and open-source are natural extensions of that mindset, not side activities.

Away from screens, I’m a proud parent and a family-first person. I try to stay grounded by spending time outdoors, moving my body, and being present with the people I love.

Graficos.net is my personal corner of the web, it exists to share what matters to me right now, knowing that it will keep changing — just like we all do.

I hope you enjoy it, dear visitor.
