Graficos.net has always been my personal website. **My father** gave me this domain back in **2001**, when I was a teenager just starting to explore the web. Over the years, it has evolved alongside my interests and passions, serving as a digital canvas for my projects, experiments, and thoughts. A forever WIP that reflects my journey in the world of Web Engineering.
